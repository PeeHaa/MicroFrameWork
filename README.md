MicroFramework
==============

MicroFrameWork is a lightweight PHP framework which utilizes the MVC pattern.

This is the first version of the MicroFramework.

This is just the development release and should never be used in a production  
environment. If you are adventurous you might want to check it out, but don't  
expect any support while it is still in development phase.

Why another freaking framework?
-------------------------------

First of all because of the experience I would like to gain. And second: ever just  
openened an random (popular) framework's source code? Doesn't that just look like  
a train wreck (e.g. [Cake][1] anyone)?

Disclaimer
----------

Again this is just a development release so don't complain when it sets your cat  
on fire or it makes you monitor blow up in your face. But serious: while in  
development I may and *will* change the code and I will break BC.

There are still some ~~'ugly' parts~~ rough edges that needs to be improved  
before I will be release it as stable.
