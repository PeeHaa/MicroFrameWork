MicroFramework
==============

MicroFrameWork is a lightweight PHP framework which utilizes the MVC pattern.

This is the first version of the MicroFramework.

This is just the development release and should never be used in a production  
environment. If you are adventurous you might want to check it out, but don't  
expect any support while it is still in development phase.

Why another freaking framework?
-------------------------------

First of all because of the experience I would like to gain. And second: ever just  
openened an random (popular) framework's source code? Doesn't that just look like  
a train wreck ([Cake][1] anyone)?
